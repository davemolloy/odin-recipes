    <p class="description">
        Zaru soba is a Japanese dish consisting of chilled buckwheat noodles served on a bamboo tray (zaru) with a dipping sauce (tsuyu). The noodles are typically garnished with nori (seaweed) and accompanied by condiments like wasabi, green onions, and grated daikon. It is a refreshing and light dish, especially popular in the summer.
